# üöó HijackUMass

A rideshare-style web app for UMass Amherst students to coordinate carpooling ‚Äî whether you **need a ride** or **have a ride to offer**.

- **Frontend**: React (Vite)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express
- More to come ;)

---

## üì¶ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/felipavil/HijackUMass-CS320.git
cd HijackUMass-CS320

```
### 2. Install dependencies

```bash

npm install

```

### 3. Set up environment variables
To run this project locally, you need to configure environment variables.
There are two .env files, one in the root, one in /server.

1. Copy the example .env file (MacOS):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
If you're on Windows:

```bash
copy .env.example .env
```
Then fill in the .env posted on Slack (or somewhere else we agreed to)

## üöÄ Running the App

### 1. Start the backend server

In one terminal window/tab:

```bash
cd server
node index.js
```
This will start your Express backend (e.g. on http://localhost:3000).

### 2. Start the frontend (React)
In a second terminal window/tab:

```bash
cd HijackUMass-CS320/
npm run dev
```
This runs the Vite dev server (usually at http://localhost:5173).

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Setup

### Prerequisites

- **PostgreSQL**: Ensure PostgreSQL is installed on your machine.  
  For installation instructions, visit [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

### Create the Databases

Open a terminal and run the following commands to create the databases:

```bash
For production (or main testing)
createdb carpool

For demo or additional testing
createdb carpool_demo

Run the following commands from the project root (or wherever the SQL files are located):

```bash
psql -d carpool -f carpool.sql
psql -d carpool_demo -f carpool_demo.sql

Then execute SQL queries such as:

SELECT * FROM users;
SELECT * FROM posts;
SELECT * FROM matches;
SELECT * FROM ride_history;
SELECT * FROM reviews;

You should see example users like Alice Rider and Bob Driver, along with their associated posts and matches.
